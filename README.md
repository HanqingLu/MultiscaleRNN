# MultiscaleRNN

This is a PyTorch implementation of the ICLR 2017 paper "HIERARCHICAL MULTISCALE RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS" (https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1di0sfgl).

# Acknowledgement 

I have no affiliation with the authors of the paper and I am implementing this code for non-commercial reasons.

The authors published their official Tensorflow implementation here (https://github.com/n-s-f/hierarchical-rnn), so check it out for something that is guaranteed to work as intended. From what I gather, their implementation is slightly different than mine, so that may be something I will investigate in the future.

You should also cite the paper if you use any of this code for your research:
